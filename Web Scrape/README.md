# Learning Web Scraping with Python

I am currently learning web scraping with Python, and to practice my skills, I am using the website [Scrape This Site](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/).

## Objectives

### Forms, Searching, and Pagination
- Learn to handle web forms: searching, filtering, and submitting.
- Understand how to navigate through paginated search results.

### AJAX and Javascript
- Discover how content is dynamically added to the page using AJAX and Javascript.
- Learn techniques to scrape data loaded asynchronously.
- Practice using tools like Selenium for interacting with and waiting for dynamic content to load.

### Frames & iFrames
- Understand the use of frames and iframes in web design.
- Develop techniques to extract data within nested iframes.
- Learn the distinction between frames and iframes and how to effectively navigate both.

### Advanced Topics
- Spoofing headers to mimic browser requests.
- Handling user logins and maintaining sessions with cookies.
- Extracting and submitting CSRF tokens for secure web forms.
- Managing common network errors such as timeouts and retries.

### Gain Proficiency with Multiple Python Libraries:
   - `Requests` for fetching web content.
   - `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content.
   - `Selenium` for interacting with JavaScript-heavy sites.
   - `Scrapy` for advanced scraping and web crawling.
   - `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `lxml` for efficient XML and HTML processing.
   - `Pyppeteer` for headless browsing and scraping modern web applications.
